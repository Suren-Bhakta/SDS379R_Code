# Here is a detailed description of every file in the repository:
## Data Creation: This is where the original file was created 
## Data Modeling: This is where all the visuals used in my paper can be found
## Data Visualizations: This holds all the other figures that were made. Although they did not make my final paper, they were crucial towards my understanding of the dataset
## New Master File: This is where all the models were built and ran with their respective graphs

Due to my data set being very large, all I can do to show it is via screenshot below:<img width="729" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 6 57 04â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91646194-a1b2-4609-aa21-bb921a17ed8e" />
